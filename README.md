## ACPIBatteryManager by RehabMan

Changed for better working on MacOSX Sierra Dell Inspiron 5557

### Original Credits

Most of the base code for AppleSmartBatteryManager and AppleSmartBattery created by gsly on insanelymac.com, no doubt with influences from the many other ACPI battery implementations that were out there.

Other ideas brought in by myself, some borrowed from zprood on insanelymac.com.

Zprood - cycle count hack in _BIF
